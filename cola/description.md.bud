ðŸ›… mulle-storage manages instances of structs

Why is this better than malloc ? It can be useful as a storage for nodes
of a tree, which grows and shrinks. It may be faster and it may produce less
fragmentation and it may improve locality of reference.

Freed nodes will be reused and all the tree nodes can be "blown" away without
having to free each node individually.
