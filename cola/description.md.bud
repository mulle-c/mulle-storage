ðŸ›… mulle-storage manages instances of a single struct

Why not just use malloc ? It can be for example useful as a storage for nodes
of a tree. It may be faster and it may produce less fragmentation and it may
improve locality of reference. Freed nodes will be reused and all the tree
nodes can be "blown" away without having to free each node individually.
