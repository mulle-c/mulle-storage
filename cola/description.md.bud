Why not just use `malloc` ? **mulle-storage** can be useful as a storage for 
nodes of a tree. It's likely faster and it may produce less fragmentation and 
it may improve locality of reference. Freed nodes will be reused. All the tree
nodes can be "blown" away at once, without having to free each node
individually.

Why not use a `mulle_structarray` ?  A struct array can realloc and so pointers
inside the struct array are not stable.
